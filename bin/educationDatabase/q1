Who was the founder of the equation of f=ma?
1. Copernicus
2. Newton
3. Galileo
4. Archimedes 
2
This equation is a part of three laws.
Newton created the three laws of motion. f=ma (force = mass * acceleration) is the second law of motion.
What is the speed of sound at sea level on Earth?
1. 3 * 10^8 m/s
2. 401 m/s
3. 300 miles per hour
4. 340 m/s
4
A typical modern jet travels at 1 to 2 times the speed of sound
The speed of sound at sea level is approximately 340 meters per second.
What unit of measurement is used to measure the speed of a fighter jet?
1. Miles per hour
2. Mach
3. Knots
4. Meters per second
2
Using this unit of measure, speeds are below ten units.
Mach measures the speed of a fighter jet. 1 mach is equal to the speed of sound at the altitude the jet is flying.
How is density calculated?
1. Mass * gravity
2. Force / area
3. Pressure * Volume
4. Mass / Volume
4
Density is how compact something is
By definition, density is the mass per unit of volume. (mg = gravitational force, f/a = pressure, PV is a constant in ideal gas)
What is the highest speed a jet has ever traveled?
1. 6500 kmph
2. 4012 kmph
3. 7200 kmph
4. 9200 kmph
3
Fastest jet is named X-15, if that helps at all
The X-15, made by Americans, can travel at mach 6.70, which is approximately 7200 kmph.
What is not a type of energy?
1. Electric
2. Kinetic
3. Potential
4. Inertia
4
Energy has the capability to do work and is measured in Joules
Inertia is not a type of energy, it is only a property dependent on the mass of an object.
What law do engineers use to move spaceships in space?
1. Conservation of momentum
2. Conservation of mass
3. Conservation of calories
4. Conservation of energy
1
There’s no air molecules in space
Spaceships shootout gas particles at very high speeds in the opposite direction, launching it forward. These principles are based on the conservation of momentum.
Which of the following is NOT a renewable resource?
1. Wind
2. Sun
3. Fossil Fuels
4. Ocean Tides
3
What is not “infinite”?
Fossils are continually being produced but are considered nonrenewable because we use them much faster than they are created.
